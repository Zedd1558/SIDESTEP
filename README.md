# SIDESTEP
A simple 3d physics-based game in which the player has to traverse a road avoiding blocks in a space car.
# Development
This is my first game that I tried in Unity. The gameplay is simple. Just avoid the blocks and go as far as you can.\
The space car is collected from Unity asset store. 
# Controls
Use left and right key to control. You can use A and D too.

# Further Works 
So far the gameplay is quite simple. In the further updates multiple levels will added with increasing difficulty. The car will be provided blasters to shoot.
